    question: "Who makes the instruments?",

  },
  {
    question: "Are they really handmade?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Every shaker is hand-filled and hand-painted. Every stomp box is hand-built and hand-decorated. No two instruments are exactly alike — that's part of what makes them special.",
  },

  },
  {
    question: "Are they suitable for young children?",
    answer:
      "Shakers are suitable for children aged 3 and up (with adult supervision for under-5s). Stomp boxes are recommended for ages 5 and up. All products are sealed so nothing can fall out.",
